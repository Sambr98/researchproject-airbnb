# Modeling Urban Deprivation via Natural Language Processing: an Airbnb Case Study
Public Repository for MEng Final Year Research Project

The repository contains the code used in the project, including pre-processing and analysis Python notebooks. It is important to note that the datasets used in the analysis have not been included, to follow data privacy regulations.

The repository is organised as follows:
 - `DataPreprocessing` contains all pre-processing notebooks. It includes code to prepare the Airbnb datasets, but also to engineer socio-economic indices, in both the UK and the US.
 - `Baseline` is composed of  notebooks to create baseline datasets, along with code to make estimations using them.
 - `Part1_Style` contains the code implemented for the style analysis, including features computation and estimations, with both Linear Regression and Random Forests.
 - `Part2_Content` contains the notebooks used for all content-based methods, including the LIWC, own-built dictionary and word2vec approaches.
